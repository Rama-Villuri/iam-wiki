# iam-wiki
Welcome to the IAM Wiki! This repository is a resource for information and best practices related to identity and access management (IAM).

IAM is a critical component of any organization's security strategy, as it controls who has access to what resources within the organization. In this repository, you will find information on a variety of IAM-related topics, including user account management, password policies, access control, and more.

I hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about IAM and how it can help protect an organization's assets. If you have any suggestions for additional content that you would like to see in this repository, please don't hesitate to let me know.

## Best practices for IAM

<WORK IN PROGRESS>
  
  Welcome to the IAM Best Practices section of our repository! In this section, i will cover a variety of best practices for managing identities and access within an organization. These practices can help ensure that your IAM systems are secure, efficient, and compliant with industry standards.

It is important to note that IAM is a complex and ever-evolving field, and what works best for one organization may not be the best solution for another. With that in mind, I encourage you to use these best practices as a starting point and tailor them to the specific needs of your organization.

  * **Least privilege:** Grant users the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties, and regularly review and revoke unnecessary permissions.
  
* **Segregation of duties:** Divide responsibilities among multiple users to reduce the risk of fraud and errors.
  
* **Access certification:** Regularly review and certify the accuracy of user access to systems and applications.
  
* **Multi-factor authentication:** Use multiple forms of authentication, such as passwords and biometrics, to increase the security of user access.
  
* **Strong passwords:** Implement password policies that require strong, unique passwords, and regularly enforce password changes.
  
* **Identity federation:** Use identity federation to securely link external identity providers, such as Active Directory or LDAP, with your systems and applications.
  
* **Access control:** Use access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC), to enforce fine-grained access policies.
  
* **Identity management:** Implement processes and systems for managing user identities, including provisioning, de-provisioning, and password reset.
  
* **Auditing and logging:** Enable auditing and logging of user access and activity, and regularly review and analyze the logs to detect and prevent security threats.
  
* **Compliance:** Understand and comply with relevant regulations and standards, such as GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA, that relate to IAM.
  
* **Risk assessment:** Conduct regular risk assessments to identify and prioritize IAM risks, and implement controls to mitigate those risks.
  
* **Continuous improvement:** Regularly review and improve your IAM processes and systems, and stay up to date with industry best practices and developments.
  
* **Employee education:** Educate employees on IAM best practices, such as strong password hygiene and the importance of protecting access credentials.
  
* **Automation:** Use automation tools and processes to streamline and optimize your IAM operations, such as provisioning, de-provisioning, and access request and approval.
  
* **Integration:** Integrate your IAM systems with other IT systems and applications, such as HR systems and cloud services, to enable seamless and secure access.
  
* **Incident response:** Develop and implement an incident response plan to handle IAM-related incidents, such as unauthorized access or data breaches.
  
* **Identity governance:** Implement identity governance processes and systems to enforce access policies, certify access accuracy, and monitor user activity.
  
* **Identity analytics:** Use identity analytics tools and techniques to identify and prevent security threats, such as insider threats and abnormal access patterns.
  
* **Cloud identity:** Use cloud identity services to manage user access to cloud applications and resources.
  
* **Passwordless authentication:** Consider using passwordless authentication methods, such as biometrics or security keys, to improve security and user experience.
