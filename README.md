# iam-wiki
Welcome to the IAM Wiki! This repository is a resource for information and best practices related to identity and access management (IAM).

IAM is a critical component of any organization's security strategy, as it controls who has access to what resources within the organization. In this repository, you will find information on a variety of IAM-related topics, including user account management, password policies, access control, and more.

We hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about IAM and how it can help protect an organization's assets. If you have any suggestions for additional content that you would like to see in this repository, please don't hesitate to let us know.
