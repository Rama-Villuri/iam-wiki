Welcome to the IAM Wiki! This repository is a resource for information and best practices related to identity and access management (IAM).

IAM is a critical component of any organization's security strategy, as it controls who has access to what resources within the organization. In this repository, you will find information on a variety of IAM-related topics, including user account management, password policies, access control, and more.

We hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about IAM and how it can help protect an organization's assets.
